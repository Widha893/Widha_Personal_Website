                      <h4>November 2024 to April 2025</h4>
                      <p>
                        For my bachelor's thesis, I am conducting research on position 
                        holding control tuning for a quadrotor using the Hardware-in-
                        the-Loop (HITL) method. The idea is to build a simulation 
                        loop, environment, and models using ROS2 and Gazebo to test 
                        the quadrotor’s stability. A physical flight controller 
                        prototype based on Teensy 4.1 will be used to receive state 
                        data from the simulation. The flight controller will then 
                        calculate control signals using a full-state feedback 
                        control algorithm and send them back to the simulation to 
                        control the quadrotor model. If the model is unstable, we can 
                        adjust the stability gains using the LQR method until the 
                        quadrotor becomes stable. This approach allows us to evaluate 
                        the performance of the control algorithm without using a real 
                        quadrotor.
